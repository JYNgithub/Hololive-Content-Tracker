## Future note:
ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
nicegui 2.21.1 requires h11>=0.16.0, but you have h11 0.9.0 which is incompatible.
nicegui 2.21.1 requires httpx>=0.24.0, but you have httpx 0.13.3 which is incompatible.
